<h2>About</h2>
While there are options available for finding gluten-free eating establishments, most apps have a pay wall that makes it difficult to sort by safety, leaving the end user to comb through tons of entries to find a place to get lunch. As someone with Celiac myself, I've been annoyed by this more than once. The goal of this project is to create a forum when users can search/review/edit places nearby that are safe for eating so that the next time someone with Celiac needs to go out to eat, they don't have to make their friends wait for 20 minutes while they find the one taco place across town that won't send them to the hospital.
